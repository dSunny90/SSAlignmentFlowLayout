## Features

- Configure a single alignment for all sections, or use closures for section-specific logic.
- Optionally limit the number of rows per section.
- Integrates seamlessly with Interface Builder or programmatically.

## Usage
```swift
// 1. Single static alignment for all sections
collectionView.collectionViewLayout = SSAlignmentFlowLayout(alignment: .left)

// 2. Dynamic alignment & row limit via closures (safe of retain cycles)
collectionView.collectionViewLayout = SSAlignmentFlowLayout(
    alignmentProvider: { [weak self] section in
        guard let self else { return .left }
        return self.alignment(for: section)
    },
    limitOfRowsProvider: { section in
        section == 0 ? 2 : 0
    }
)
```
